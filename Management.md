#Management Task
***Steps to conduct a successful event***

1) Keep it a **hands-on session** as they are much more interactive and informative than just a speaker event.
2) Get an **industry expert** on AI either someone who is currently working in the domain or has done some research on it.
3) Create an **expense report** and try to see whether any sponsorships are required.
4) **Delegate** the _task_ with my team so each task is running simultaneously rather than one person doing multiple jobs.
5) **Capture** the _event_ like the presentation, or just photos of the attendees.
6) **Share** the _minutes_ or any resources used during the event to the attendees.
7) **Book a proper venue** to accomodate the _tentative number_ of participant and in-case of an hands on session try to give the basic necessities like power chords, etc.
8) In case there is no **PA System** already available with the club, find the proper system to book for the duration of the event.
9) Do **Pitching/social media campaigns** to announce the event and incase there will be participants from other college create proper invitations to send either to the students or to the respective management of the college.
10) Create a **Souvenier** like swags for the event, it can even be a QR code printed on a bottle, tshirt which takes them to a webpage regarding the event
